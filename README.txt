This started as an example with using HTML5 and turned into
an easy paint program, perfect for children. While traditional
paint programs require holding down the mouse button to draw,
HTML5 Easy Paint uses continuous draw! Just move the mouse around
the screen to draw. Additional features include a basic selection
of colors, fill tool, and image stamps.
